\# General



There's a gear icon in the top right for settings.







\# New game screen



"Select story seeds"



Players words or phrases gently gliding from left to right. They're clickable, and clicking one causes it to "pop" and appear at the bottom of their page in the "Vibes" box.  They can manually type their own. Once they've typed a few words or selected a few of the vibes gliding by, the "begin creating world" button lights up. Clicking this will advance them to...







\# Building World Screen



At the top we see "progress:" and we have a set of green lights that start dark and light up with each step completed. Each step features a chat in the bottom center of the screen to help them think of ideas.







\## STEP 1: Select Story Hook



\- A chat window on the bottom, and 3 tiles on top. The tiles show short plot and world summaries based on the vibe words they picked. They can select one or use the chat (labeled "suggestion changes to the DM" to have a new set of 3 generated based on their suggestions. This ensures that the story and world always have something they like. Once they select one, a green "next" button lights up.







STEP 2: Summaries



\- 3 editable text boxes are populated with summaries of the "World" "Story" and "Character". Players can edit these or approve them. The chat is labeled "brainstorm with the dm". Once all 3 are approved, the green "next" button lights up.







STEP 3: Character Details



There's a list of skills with a point-buy system. Once players point buy, it reveals the following:







The character's species, age, name, gender, and traits are all prefilled with suggestions the LLM provided based on our character summary earlier and the player stats. There's a button to regenerate these, or the player can edit them.







STEP 4: Select Scene Hook



After a bunch of the world has been filled out, the player is present with 3 hooks for the first scene (much like the initial story hook selection). Using the same approach as before, once they're happy they select "next"







From there, they wait for a while while world generation finishes and then we plunge them into the first scene!







\# Scene UI



We need a player UI. It has a left pane that shows scene history, a right pane that shows player information (with tabs for description, status, stats). On the top right we need a gear for settings. Center is the chat window, what the DM Voice (or punchup agent) actually types and is shown to the player. 







\# End scene UI



After a scene is concluded, the player is asked what they're doing next. They will have 3 suggestions to choose from or can write their own. They will then be asked what they did to prepare, given 3 choices that they cannot edit. Once they select one, the next scene is generated and we return to that UI.
